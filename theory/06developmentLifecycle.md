# Development Lifecycle

## What is in it?
- There are 4 parts:
    - Analysis
    - Design
    - Coding
    - Testing

- It is used to:
    - Break down large problems into smaller, clear and manageable parts

- It is also known as SDLC

## Part 1: Analysis
- Includes:
    - Abstraction
    - Problem decomposition
    - Identification
    - Requirements

- Abstraction:
    - Identify key components and functions of the system

- Problem Decomposition:
    - Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks

- Identification:
    - Identify system requirements and constraints

- Requirements:
    - Prioritise what is needed of the program

## Part 2: Design
- Includes:
    - Further decomposition
    - Structure diagrams
    - Flowcharts
    - Pseudocode

- Further decomposition:
    - Break down the system into modules or components

- Structure diagrams:
    - Create diagrams to visualise the system structure 

- Flowcharts:
    - Flow of control throughout the system
    - Identify decision points, loops and branching logic

- Pseudocode:
    - Outlines logic of each module or components

- Tip:
    - Think about IPO:
        - Input
        - Process
        - Output

## Part 3: Coding
- Includes:
    - Writing program code
    - Iterative testing

- Writing program code:
    - Implements the code in accordance to the design
    - Document code for understanding and maintenance

- Iterative testing:
    - Test code as it is written
    - Use unit tests
    - Address any issues 

## Part 4: Testing
- Includes:
    - Testing program code with a variety of test data

- Testing:
    - Develop test cases
    - Test inputs within expected ranges as well as boundary ranges
