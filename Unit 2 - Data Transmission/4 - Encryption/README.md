# Encryption
- Process of turning data into an *unreadable form* so it doesn't make sense to attackers and hackers

## Plaintext and Ciphertext
- Plaintext: original data
- Ciphertext: data after encryption

## Symmetric Encryption
- Uses 1 encryption key for the encryption and decryption

## Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses 2 keys: Public and Private
- Public key available to everyone
- Private key only available to the user
- Sender encrypts message with public key and can only be decrypted using private key
