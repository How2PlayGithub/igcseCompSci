The 1D array TeamName[] contains the names of teams in a sport league
The 2D array TeamPoints[] contains the points awarded for each match
The position of each team's data in the two arrays is the same. For example, the team
stored at index 10 in TeamName[] and TeamPoints[] is the same.

The variable LeagueSize contains the number of teams in the league. The variable MatchNo
contains the number of matches played. All teams have played the same number of games.

The arrays and variables have already been set up and the data stored.

Each match can be played at home or away. Points are recorded for the match results of each
team with the following values:
3 - away win
2 - home win
1 - drawn match
0 - lost match

Write a program that meets the following requirement:
calculate the total points for each team
count the total number of away wins, home wins, drawn matches and lost matches
output for each team:
    name
    total points
    total number of away, home, drawn and lost
find and output:
    the name of the team with highest points, and the number of points
    the name of the team with the lowest points, and the number of points

You must use pseudocode or program code AND add comments to explain how your code works

You do NOT need to declare any arrays, variables, or constants; you may assume that this
has already been done.

All inputs and outputs must contain suitable messages

You do NOT need to initialise the data in the arrays TeamName[] and TeamPoints[] or the 
variable LeagueSize and MatchNo
