# Images

## Bitmap Images
- Made up of pixels
- Stored in a computer as a series of binary numbers

## Color (Colour) Depth
- Number of bits representing each color
- 8-bit color depth = 256 colors
- 16-bit color depth = 65536 colors
- 1-bit color depth = 2 colors (black and white)
- Increase color depth = Increase in color accuracy = Increase in Storage / File Size

## Image Resolution
- Number of pixels that make up an image
- Lower resolution = Less Detail
- When an image is 'blurry' or 'fizzy', it's called `pixelated`
- High Resolution = High Detail = High Storage / File Size

## Calculate File Size
- Image Resolution (pixels) x Color Depth (bits)
