# Sound

- Analogue
- To convert to digital form, it is sampled
- Sampled at *regular time intervals* where *amplitude* is measured
- Cannot be measured precisely
    - Approximate values are stored

## Recorded
- Amplitude of sound waves first measured at *set time intervals*
- Values converted to digital form
- Sample of the sound wave is then encoded as a series of binary digits
- Series of readings give an approximate representation of the sound wave

## Sampling Resolution
- Number of bits per sample
- Increase sampling resolution = Increase in accuracy (of the sampled sound) = Increase in storage / file size

## Sampling Rate
- Number of sound samples taken per second
- Measured in Hertz (Hz)
- Increase Sampling Rate = Increase in accuracy (of sound because there are fewer estimations done between samples) = Increase in storage / file size

## Calculate File Size
- Sample Rate (Hz) x Sample Resolution (bits) x length (seconds)
