# Hexadecimal

## What is hexadecimal?
Hexadecimal is a number system using base-16
Hexadecimal is more commonly known as `hex`

## Hexadecimal system
| denary | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hexadecimal | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |

## Convert from hexadecimal to denary
You will ONLY need to convert one or two digit hexadecimals
For example, to convert 3B:
1. Multiply the first number in the sequence by 16. In our case, it'll be `3*16 = 48`
2. Add the number following it to your first result. In our case, it'll be `48 + 11 = 59`

## Convert from denary to hexadecimal
Take the example 73. To convert to hexadecimal:
1. Divide your number by 16. In our case, it'll be `73 / 16 = 4 remainder 9` 
So the hexadecimal value will be `49`

## Convert from binary to hexadecimal
Take the example 10110110, to convert to hexadecimal:
1. You need to take a binary sequence of 8 bits and change it into 2 nibbles (4 bits). In our case, it'll be `1011 0110`
2. Convert each nibble into its hexadecimal value. In our case `1011 = B` and `0110 = 6` 
So the hexadecimal value will be B6

## Convert from hexadecimal to binary
Take the example 9C. To convert to binary:
1. Split the 2 digits and change it into binary seperately in nibbles. In our case, `9 = 1001` and `C = 1100`
2. Combine the 2 binary sequences
So the binary for `9C` will be `10011100`
