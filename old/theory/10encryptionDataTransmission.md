# Encryption

## What is it?
- A process of turning data into an unreadable form so it doesn't make sense to hackers or attackers without the correct key/algorithm

## Definitions
- Plaintext:
    - The original data being sent
- Ciphertext:
    - The text given after encryption

## Symmetric encryption
- Uses an encryption key for the encryption process
- Same key for encryption and decryption 

- Uses:
    - Wifi 
    - Adding a password to a `.zip` file
    - Encrypting a HDD 

## Asymmetric encryption
- 2 keys:
    - Public
    - Private
- Public key is available to everyone, whereas the private is only available to the user
- Receiver would have the private key
- Public key is sent to the sender
- Sender can encrypt the message with the public key
- Can only be decrypted using private key

- Uses (good to know but not needed):
    - SSH
    - VPN
    - TLS/SSL
    - IPsec
    - PGP/GPG
